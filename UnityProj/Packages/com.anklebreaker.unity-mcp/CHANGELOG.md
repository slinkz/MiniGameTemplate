  - Async job-based pattern with deferred execution on Unity main thread
  - Supports filtering by test name, category, assembly, or group
- **Compilation error tracking via CompilationPipeline** — Dedicated error buffer independent of console log

  - `CompilationPipeline.compilationStarted` auto-clears buffer on new compilation cycle
  - Thread-safe with lock-based synchronization
